## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Strategy & Backtesting

- [x] **1. Strategy Builder GUI v1** — `StrategyBuilderDialog` with Active / New / Templates tabs. 4 one-click presets (MA cross, RSI oversold, bullish engulfing, London session breakout). Block-based condition rows + open-position action with sizing/SL/TP/cooldown. Reuses `/api/signals` with `indicatorSpecs` thread so MA params actually take effect.
- [x] **2. Backtester v1** — `runMaCrossBacktest` engine + `POST /api/alerts/:id/backtest` route + result modal in Active tab. Pulls up to 1000 bars from candleStore (fetches from provider when sparse). Per-trade: enter on cross (RSI-gated when set), exit on reverse cross. Stats: trades, win rate, total return %, max DD %, Sharpe, profit factor, avg win/loss, avg bars. v1 model — no SL/TP/fees/slippage (Phase 1 #3 picks those up).
- [x] **3. Param optimizer v1** — `runOptimizer` engine + `POST /api/alerts/:id/optimize`. Grid sweeps fast/slow MA lengths (and RSI thresholds when filter set), reuses backtester per combo, ranks by composite score (Sharpe − 0.02 × Max-DD). UI: Sliders icon per alert row → results table with Apply button to overwrite alert config.
- [x] **4. Walk-forward analysis v1** — `runWalkForward` engine + `POST /api/alerts/:id/walk-forward`. Rolling 250-bar train / 60-bar test windows. Optimizer picks per train slice, OOS backtest on test slice. Aggregates OOS equity + computes robustness (OOS Sharpe / mean train Sharpe). UI: Shuffle icon → modal with 8 stat cards (Generalises ≥0.7 / Marginal 0.3-0.7 / Curve-fit <0.3) + per-window picks table.
- [x] **5. Paper-trading mode v1** — per-alert `delivery.paper` flag. Engine opens a virtual position on every cross fire, closes + flips on opposite fire. Persisted in `paper_trades`. New routes: GET `/api/alerts/:id/paper-trades`, GET `/api/alerts/paper/summary`, POST `/api/alerts/:id/paper/reset` (close-open or wipe). UI: ClipboardList icon per alert row → modal with toggle, 4 stat cards (Closed / Win rate / Total return / W-L), live open-position card, closed-trades table, Close-open + Wipe-history actions.

### Phase 2 — Risk & Portfolio

- [x] **6. Position sizer v1** — `apps/api/src/position-sizer.ts` with pure helpers for fixed_lots / risk_percent / cash_risk / kelly (fractional 0.25) / atr_scaled. Route `POST /api/alerts/:id/sizer-preview` backtests the alert to derive Kelly inputs (winRate, avg win/loss) + reads latest ATR, returns lot suggestions across all 5 modes. UI: Calculator icon per alert row → modal with 6 inputs (balance/risk%/risk$/SL pips/$pip/fixed lots), 4 backtest stat cards, side-by-side results table with formula breakdown.
- [ ] 7. Portfolio heat — open-position correlation matrix + sector exposure pie

- [ ] 23. Mobile responsive terminal
- [ ] 24. PWA install + offline last-known snapshot
- [ ] 25. WASM-accelerated indicator pass

## Working agreement (for Claude loop)

- Never fabricate market data. Never fake API responses.
- Never break the live alerts or Telegram config that's already wired.
- Verify every feature with a browser screenshot before commit.
- Commit small. One feature → one commit.
- Update the **Last session** / **Next pick** footer before each commit.
- If blocked, append to **Questions for owner** + skip to next item.

## Last session

- 📸 **Alert chart photos to Telegram** — every BUY/SELL alert now ships with a rendered
  PNG of the crossover so it's self-proving (owner asked: "send a photo that cross is
  happening on that symbol").
- `apps/api/src/alert-chart.ts` (NEW): server-side candlestick renderer via
  `@napi-rs/canvas` (prebuilt N-API binary — no native build, ABI-stable on Node 26).
  Draws candles + both EMA legs + a BUY/SELL triangle-and-chip **on the exact bar that
  crossed**, using the SAME `computeMaCross` math as the fire, so the picture can't drift
  from the signal. Dark theme matches the terminal; price axis, time axis (date for ≥1d,
  time intraday), legend, watermark. ~10-30ms, ~65KB PNG.
- `telegram.ts`: new `sendTelegramPhoto()` — multipart `sendPhoto` built from native
  FormData + Blob (no new HTTP dep), 15s timeout.
- `alert-engine.ts`: on a telegram fire, render the chart and send it as a photo with the
  alert text as caption; **degrades to text-only** if render or upload fails (an alert is
  never dropped). `sourceNote` tags the feed (Binance/Yahoo/…).
- Verified: rendered real BTC 30m (SELL + BUY) + ETH 1d charts, marker lands exactly on
  the cross; **sent a live verification photo to the owner's chat** (BTC/USDT 30m). Both
  BUY (green triangle below) + SELL (red triangle above) confirmed.
- Confirmed `/api/candles` returns sorted, dedup'd, stable bars (ruled out a data-ordering
  cause for bad crosses). 144 alerts + 3 Telegram bots untouched.

## Earlier

- 🔴→🟢 Fixed the **cold-start false-alert flood** ("alerts coming wrong"): on boot 81
  alerts fired in one second because the Yahoo poll emitted a batch of recent bars and the
  engine replayed each pre-existing cross. New `initSubscription()` backfills real history
  + seeds `lastFiredAt` to the newest bar BEFORE wiring the listener, so only bars closing
  after subscribe can fire. Verified 0 events / no burst post-restart. Crypto could never
  flood (Binance WS streams one closed bar at a time; backfill/upsert are bus-silent) — the
  flood was the 114 forex alerts waking up on Yahoo; the 30 crypto alerts were clean.
- Free FX/metals/indices via `YahooProvider` (no OANDA token). 114 subs verified.
- Fixed 3 review bugs (ATR pip-size, telegram-status persist, MA warmup window).
- Live PnL on paper trades (TradingView-style), portfolio aggregate route + 3s modal.

## Next pick

**Phase 2 · #7 — Portfolio heat.** Open-position correlation matrix + sector exposure
pie. Goal: surface "I have 5 EUR-pair longs that all move together" so the trader
can throttle correlated risk before MT5 fires them.
