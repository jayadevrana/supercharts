## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Strategy & Backtesting

- [x] **1. Strategy Builder GUI v1** — `StrategyBuilderDialog` with Active / New / Templates tabs. 4 one-click presets (MA cross, RSI oversold, bullish engulfing, London session breakout). Block-based condition rows + open-position action with sizing/SL/TP/cooldown. Reuses `/api/signals` with `indicatorSpecs` thread so MA params actually take effect.
- [x] **2. Backtester v1** — `runMaCrossBacktest` engine + `POST /api/alerts/:id/backtest` route + result modal in Active tab. Pulls up to 1000 bars from candleStore (fetches from provider when sparse). Per-trade: enter on cross (RSI-gated when set), exit on reverse cross. Stats: trades, win rate, total return %, max DD %, Sharpe, profit factor, avg win/loss, avg bars. v1 model — no SL/TP/fees/slippage (Phase 1 #3 picks those up).
- [x] **3. Param optimizer v1** — `runOptimizer` engine + `POST /api/alerts/:id/optimize`. Grid sweeps fast/slow MA lengths (and RSI thresholds when filter set), reuses backtester per combo, ranks by composite score (Sharpe − 0.02 × Max-DD). UI: Sliders icon per alert row → results table with Apply button to overwrite alert config.
- [x] **4. Walk-forward analysis v1** — `runWalkForward` engine + `POST /api/alerts/:id/walk-forward`. Rolling 250-bar train / 60-bar test windows. Optimizer picks per train slice, OOS backtest on test slice. Aggregates OOS equity + computes robustness (OOS Sharpe / mean train Sharpe). UI: Shuffle icon → modal with 8 stat cards (Generalises ≥0.7 / Marginal 0.3-0.7 / Curve-fit <0.3) + per-window picks table.
- [x] **5. Paper-trading mode v1** — per-alert `delivery.paper` flag. Engine opens a virtual position on every cross fire, closes + flips on opposite fire. Persisted in `paper_trades`. New routes: GET `/api/alerts/:id/paper-trades`, GET `/api/alerts/paper/summary`, POST `/api/alerts/:id/paper/reset` (close-open or wipe). UI: ClipboardList icon per alert row → modal with toggle, 4 stat cards (Closed / Win rate / Total return / W-L), live open-position card, closed-trades table, Close-open + Wipe-history actions.

### Phase 2 — Risk & Portfolio

- [x] **6. Position sizer v1** — `apps/api/src/position-sizer.ts` with pure helpers for fixed_lots / risk_percent / cash_risk / kelly (fractional 0.25) / atr_scaled. Route `POST /api/alerts/:id/sizer-preview` backtests the alert to derive Kelly inputs (winRate, avg win/loss) + reads latest ATR, returns lot suggestions across all 5 modes. UI: Calculator icon per alert row → modal with 6 inputs (balance/risk%/risk$/SL pips/$pip/fixed lots), 4 backtest stat cards, side-by-side results table with formula breakdown.
- [x] **7. Portfolio heat v1** — `apps/api/src/portfolio-heat.ts` (pure) + `GET /api/portfolio/heat`. Pearson correlation of log returns across open paper positions (or a `?symbols=` basket). Day-bucketed alignment so cross-provider daily bars (gold futures vs spot FX vs crypto, which open at different session times) line up by UTC day. Folds position SIDE into the correlation → a *directional* concentration score (two longs on a +0.9 pair = stacked risk; long+short = hedged). Asset-class buckets + net currency exposure (EUR_USD long → +EUR / −USD; the "5 EUR longs" check). UI: **Heat tab** in the alerts dialog — concentration headline + avg|corr| + stacked-pair count, amber stacked-risk warnings (clustered via union-find), N×N correlation heatmap (red = move together, blue = offset), asset-class + net-currency bars. "Analyse active alerts" maps the watched basket; empty state when <2 open positions. Exposure is equal-weight (paper_trades carry no lot size) — stated, not faked.
- [x] **8. Per-strategy P&L attribution v1** — `apps/api/src/pnl-attribution.ts` (pure) + `GET /api/portfolio/attribution`. Rolls the paper book up three ways: per alert (strategy *instance*), per strategy *signature* (the MA/RSI recipe across every symbol it runs on), and per asset class. Realised = Σ closed `pnl_percent`; open = mark-to-market unrealized (reuses `markRow`). Per-instance: trades, win%, realised/open/total %, avg win/loss, profit factor, best/worst. UI: **P&L tab** in the alerts dialog — 4 headline cards (total/realised/open, win rate, strategy count, best/worst), per-instance table with diverging contribution bars, and by-recipe + by-asset-class rollups. 5s auto-refresh. Return attribution (equal-weight per trade) — stated, not faked. **Also fixed a latent Phase 1 #5 bug**: the zod `delivery` schema was missing `paper`, so the paper-trade toggle was silently stripped on save and no positions were ever booked — restored `paper: z.boolean().optional()`.
- [x] **9. Daily / weekly stat report v1** — `apps/api/src/stat-report.ts` (pure) + `GET /api/portfolio/report?period=daily|weekly` + `POST /api/portfolio/report/send`. Windows alert fires (`fired_at`) + closed paper trades (`exit_time`); rolls up signals (total/buy/sell + top symbols), paper P&L (realised/open/total, win rate, avg), best/worst strategy lines, active-alert count. `formatReportTelegram()` renders an HTML digest sent via the user's first enabled bot. UI: **Summary report card** atop the P&L tab — daily/weekly toggle + 4 stat cards + best/worst + a "Telegram" send button. Verified: weekly = 39 fires (22 buy/17 sell); send button delivered the digest (toast confirmed). Scheduler is external for now (cron → POST the send route); documented as a follow-up.
- [x] **10. Max-drawdown breaker v1** — `apps/api/src/dd-breaker.ts` (createDrawdownBreaker) + `routes/breaker.ts` (`GET/POST /api/portfolio/breaker`, `POST /resume`). Watches the day's P&L (injected `computeDailyPnlPct` — today the paper book: realised closed-today % + open unrealized %); when it drops ≤ −limit it HALTS the signal-runner (new addative `shouldHalt` gate — recipes evaluate but never dispatch; never deletes), fires a Telegram alert (onTrip), and auto-resets at the UTC day boundary. Manual resume holds for the day; configurable enable + limit. 60s poll in `main.ts`. UI: **Breaker card** atop the P&L tab — enable switch, today's P&L, halt-at-% input, Armed/Paused/Off status, red HALTED banner + Resume. Default `DD_LIMIT_PCT=5`, `DD_BREAKER_ENABLED` (on). Verified: isolated logic test (trip / no-double-trip / manual-resume-holds / day-rollover re-arm / disable) + live route (status + configure). **Phase 2 complete.**

### Phase 3 — Data & Integrations

- [ ] 11. OANDA token onboarding wizard (in-app form → write to user config)
- [ ] 12. News filter per watchlist (CryptoPanic + GDELT keyword scoring)
- [ ] 13. Economic calendar overlay on chart (events as vertical markers)

- [ ] 21. Stripe billing live (already scaffolded)
- [ ] 22. Persisted per-user layouts + indicators per pane
- [ ] 23. Mobile responsive terminal
- [ ] 24. PWA install + offline last-known snapshot
- [ ] 25. WASM-accelerated indicator pass

## Working agreement (for Claude loop)

- Never fabricate market data. Never fake API responses.
- Never break the live alerts or Telegram config that's already wired.
- Verify every feature with a browser screenshot before commit.
- Commit small. One feature → one commit.
- Update the **Last session** / **Next pick** footer before each commit.
- If blocked, append to **Questions for owner** + skip to next item.

## Last session

- 🧪 **Quality pass (normal mode, caveman off): test suite + working lint + first new indicators.**
  - **Vitest suite** (`tests/`, `vitest.config.ts`): 26 tests across profile-builder, ma-cross,
    indicators runner, dd-breaker, portfolio-heat, pnl-attribution, and the new volume indicators —
    all green. Import pure modules by relative source path to stay out of package tsconfigs.
  - **ESLint flat config** (`eslint.config.mjs`): `eslint .` now works monorepo-wide (0 errors,
    22 advisory warnings = pre-existing dead imports + 4 react-hooks/exhaustive-deps). Fixed 3 real
    `no-useless-assignment` errors (backtester / mt5 bridge / ws-gateway).
  - **2 new candle-derived indicators** (real on every symbol & timeframe, never faked):
    **Relative Volume (RVOL)** — bar volume ÷ prior-N average, sub-pane; and **VWAP Bands (σ)** —
    session/cumulative VWAP with ±σ volume-weighted std-dev bands, price overlay. Added to
    `packages/indicators` (volume.ts + registry + runner), wired into the blank-default Indicators
    dialog, VWAP-bands overlay case in `chart-pane.tsx`. Verified in-browser on BTCUSDT 1m + 1h:
    both render, recompute on interval change, console clean. (10 more of the requested 24 to go:
    Market Profile/TPO, Naked POC, Initial Balance, the Binance-only order-flow set, Open Interest.)
  - ⚠️ **Transient SSD unmount** mid-session (exFAT/USB nap) wedged both dev servers → remounted,
    cleared `.next`, restarted api+web; alert engine reloaded all alerts on boot. Uncommitted work
    survived the drop intact.
- 🛑 **Phase 2 #10 — Max-drawdown breaker (Phase 2 COMPLETE).** `dd-breaker.ts` +
  `routes/breaker.ts`. Watches the day's paper P&L; ≤ −limit → HALTS the signal-runner via
  an additive `shouldHalt` gate (recipes evaluate, never dispatch — never deleted), Telegram
  alert on trip, auto-reset at UTC midnight, manual resume holds for the day. Breaker card
  atop the P&L tab (enable / today P&L / halt-at-% / Resume). Verified: deterministic logic
  test (trip/no-double-trip/resume-holds/rollover-rearm/disable) + live GET+configure routes.
  (Browser card shot deferred — chrome-MCP screenshot transport was glitching.)
- 📈 **Phase 2 #9 — Daily / weekly stat report.** `apps/api/src/stat-report.ts` (pure) +
  GET `/api/portfolio/report?period=daily|weekly` + POST `/api/portfolio/report/send`.
  Windows alert fires (`fired_at`) + closed paper trades (`exit_time`) → signals
  (total/buy/sell + top symbols), paper P&L (realised/open/total, win rate), best/worst
  strategy lines, active-alert count. `formatReportTelegram()` HTML digest sent via the
  first enabled bot. UI: **Summary report card** atop the P&L tab (daily/weekly toggle +
  Telegram button). Verified: weekly = 39 fires (22 buy/17 sell); the send button delivered
  the digest (toast confirmed). External cron → POST the send route for scheduling.
- 🌐 **Read-only DEMO mode** (`DEMO_MODE=1` guard, `demo-guard.ts`) + a live **raw** 1-hour
  demo via two cloudflared quick tunnels (web + API, WS wired through). `DEMO.md` has the
  run/tunnel/FreeDomain steps. Note: quick tunnels are flaky — the edge connection dropped
  mid-session (auto-retries; hostname can change). 60-min auto-takedown watchdog armed.
- 🔌 **WS self-heal**: reconnect on tab-focus/`online`; top-bar live/reconnecting/offline badge.
- 📊 **Phase 2 #8 — P&L attribution** (`pnl-attribution.ts`) + fixed a latent Phase 1 #5 bug:
  the zod `delivery` schema was missing `paper`, so the paper-toggle was silently stripped.

## Earlier

- 🔥 **Phase 2 #7 — Portfolio heat**: correlation matrix + directional concentration +
  net-currency / asset-class exposure across open positions (or a basket). `portfolio-heat.ts`
  + `GET /api/portfolio/heat`, day-bucketed cross-provider alignment, Heat tab UI. Verified
  on a 12-symbol basket (crypto block 0.80–0.95 correlated, net −10 USDT).
- 📸 **Alert chart photos to Telegram** — every BUY/SELL alert ships a rendered crossover PNG
  (`alert-chart.ts` via `@napi-rs/canvas`); verified by a live engine fire.
- 🔴→🟢 Fixed the **cold-start false-alert flood** (`initSubscription()` backfill + watermark).
- Cleared 108 GB of dev caches off the SSD; reinstalled + rebuilt to bring services back.

## Next pick

**Continue the 24-indicator request — candle-derived set next, all real, blank-by-default.**
Done: RVOL, VWAP σ-bands. Next candle-derived (work on every symbol/timeframe, no new feed):
**Initial Balance** (first-hour session H/L), **Naked/Virgin POC** (untouched prior-session POCs),
**Market Profile / TPO**. Each needs a new chart-core overlay layer + pane flag + dialog entry +
browser verify. Then the **Binance-only order-flow set** (bid/ask & stacked imbalance, absorption,
DOM ladder, iceberg, whale/block tracker, Time & Sales) — gated to crypto, "needs data" on FX,
never faked. Then **Open Interest / liquidations** (needs a Binance-futures feed in ingestion).
After indicators: Phase 3 · #11 — OANDA token onboarding wizard.
